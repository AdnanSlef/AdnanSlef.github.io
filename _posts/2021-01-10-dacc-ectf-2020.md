# MITRE Collegiate Embedded CTF 2020

## Topic

Designing a secure Embedded audio player system with Digital Rights Management (DRM) functionality

## Overview

## Design Document

Our original design document describes our plans for the security and functionality of the device.\
The design also specifies device and song provisioning scripts to be run by the manufacturer.\
This design document is available \[[here](https://aself3-files.adrianself.me/DACC-ECTF-2020/DesignDocument.pdf)\] and included below.

## Scripts

We developed a number of Python scripts for provisioning the systems and songs.\
Links to these scripts are coming soon.

## Presentation

We were invited to an awards ceremony, where we shared a summary video.\
[Here is our 0xDACC presentation video](https://aself3-files.adrianself.me/DACC-ECTF-2020/DACC_Presentation.mp4), also embedded below.
