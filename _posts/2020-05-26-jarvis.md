## Description

*Written by vbhaip*
Tony Stark tried asking for a flag from Jarvis, but Jarvis became corrupted and only outputted these two files for some reason.

[File 1]()
[File 2]()

## Solution
This challenge gave a lot of teams a hard time, but I solved it quickly and got First Blood.

When downloaded, the two files are help.csv and flag.csv.

Let's take a look at what's inside:

help.csv
```
0,48,38,88,20,79,78,36,31,40,43
1,66,39,85,47,86,43,42,60,42,60
1,65,39,52,5,84,27,55,79,47,64
0,37,32,12,26,39,99,6,56,55,47
0,18,39,7,40,28,60,13,77,44,54
...
```

flag.csv
```
45,37,59,28,91,62,82,86,57,45
100,41,85,71,38,10,52,79,40,36
82,45,76,35,37,47,82,100,35,48
9,37,16,80,25,41,31,69,51,55
24,39,11,89,30,48,6,23,44,40
...
```

The files look similar, but help.csv has an extra column at the start. It has only ones and zeros.

Given the challenge name **Jarvis**,
