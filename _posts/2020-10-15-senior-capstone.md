# Cybersecurity Senior Capstone Project

## Topic

Breaking the Middle Square Weyl Sequence PRNG

## Essential Question

How can a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) be broken and what impacts could this have?

## Interview

Interviews were conducted with PhD students Abhiram Kothapalli (Carnegie Mellon) and Mike Specter (MIT).\
An interview summary is available \[[here](https://aself3-files.adrianself.me/Cybersecurity_Senior_Capstone/InterviewSummary.pdf)\], with topics including PRNGs, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and Verifiable Computation.

## Paper

One element of my project was a semi-formal paper addressing the vulner\
That document is availabe \[[here](https://aself3-files.adrianself.me/Cybersecurity_Senior_Capstone/Senior_Capstone_Finished.pdf)\] and included below.
